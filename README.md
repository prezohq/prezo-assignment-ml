Hi there, thanks for your interest in Prezo. We are excited to work with builders and hackers to help us shape Prezo.

A common need when working on Prezo is to come up with good prompts for AI enabled workflows. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a few such good prompts and host them behind an endpoin.

Requirements
You are building an API endpoint that can take the following actions on text sent to it.
- rewrite text
- reduce text
- write text in the style of Shakespeare 
- use a custom tone sent by the frontend to rewrite text (advanced)

Create an API endpoint that accepts text input, wraps it in a full prompt and queries an Open AI model.

It should query for text completion. (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion) You can create a free account on OpenAI and get free credits to use. You will need an API key from them.

Your API should return a JSON response of the result returned by OpenAI.

How will you evaluate different prompts? What if we want to change prompts frequently? What else should we look out for as we use this service repeatedly?

We work in python and javascript so prefer solutions in those languages, but you're free to use whichever language/framework you're most comfortable with.

Deliverables
Create a repo with your code in it.

Host it on render/railway/heroku/or any other service with free tier.

Record a short video walking us through how you crushed this

Share the repo, the video and the hosted app with us

If you are out of OpenAI credits, contact us for a key.
